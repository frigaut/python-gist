Removed-Files: opengl
Rationale: Uses GLX code
 The content of the upstream `opengl' directory may not be DFSG-free as it
 uses GLX. It is not used and is removed from the Debian source tree. For
 OpenGL support, look at yorick-gl in non-free.

Removed-Files: play/hacks/hack103.c
Rationale: Not DFSG
 play/hacks/hack103.c of the upstream sources derivates from work Copyright (c)
 1999-2003 Apple Computer, Inc. under the Apple Public Source License Version
 2.0. It is not included in the Debian sources as it is not used in the Linux
 port of Yorick and would prevent Yorick from being DFSG-free.

Removed-Files: i/idlsave.i
Rationale: Not DFSG
 i/idlsave.i in the upstream source derivates from work by Craig Markwardt. It
 is not included in the Debian package due to copyright issues. For the time
 being, extract it from the upstream source if needed.
