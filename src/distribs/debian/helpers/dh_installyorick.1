.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installyorick is a debhelper program that installs the files of
your Yorick add\-on at the right place when building a Debian
package. For a simple plug\-in package, this is mostly done by calling
"make DESTDIR=debian/<package> install" and then moving
arch\-independent files to usr/share. Note that there is no
Y_SITE/contrib directory in the Debian packages, its content is merged
into YSITE/i.
.PP
Calling "make ... install" can be disabled by using the
"\-\-no\-make\-install" flag. This is useful in particular for interpreted
add\-on packages, which do not ship with a standard Yorick Makefile.
.PP
If the "\-m" flag is used (but not the "\-n" one), dh_installyorick
will also add lines to your package's postinst and postrm scripts to
call "update\-yorickdoc \-\-auto" if the yorick\-doc package is
installed. It is necessary to call dh_installdeb after
dh_installyorick for this to work. It is usually not necessary with a
recent dpkg supporting triggers, so this possibility is kept mostly
for easing backports and should be deprecated soon.
.PP
dh_installyorick will look for a file named
debian/<package>.ynstall for additional files to install
(see \fBYNSTALL FILE\fR below). The prefix "<package>." can be
omitted for the main binary package being built (usally the first one
listed in debian/control).
.PP
For the time being, Y_SITE=Y_HOME=/usr/lib/yorick. Requests to install
a file under Y_SITE results in its installation under
/usr/share/yorick. dh_installyorick handles the creation of the
necessary symbolic links from Y_HOME to /usr/share/yorick.
.PP
Files that are installed in a directory ending in "/bin" or "/sbin",
as well as files that are pointed at by symbolic link in such a
directory, are installed with execution permission for everyone.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-m\fR\fR" 4
.IX Item "\-m"
Modify postinst/postrm scripts to add a call to
update\-yorickdoc. This is needed only if the target dpkg does not
support triggers. If both "\-m" and "\-n" are specified, the scripts
are not modified.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-make\-install\fR\fR" 4
.IX Item "\-\-no\-make\-install"
Do not call "make DESTDIR=debian/<package> install".
.IP "\fB\-\-infofile=\fR\fR" 4
.IX Item "\-\-infofile="
An additional pkg_mngr .info file to install.
.PP
Additionally, dh_installyorick abides by the following standard
debhelper options: \-a/\-\-arch, \-i/\-\-indep, \-\-mainpackage, \-n,
\-\-no\-act, \-N/\-\-no\-package, \-p/\-\-package, \-P/\-\-tmpdir,
\-s/\-\-same\-arch, and \-v/\-\-verbose.
.SH "YNSTALL FILE"
.IX Header "YNSTALL FILE"
Blank lines are ignored, several blank character are counted as one,
and line starting with "#" (possibly following one or more blanks) are
ignored. Each non\-comment, non\-blank line should be of the form:
.PP
\&\fIfile\fR [\fIdirectory\fR [\fIlink\fR]] 
.PP
Where \fIfile\fR is the file to install, \fIdirectory\fR the directory
it should be installed in, and \fIlink\fR an optional symbolic link
pointing on the installed file.
.IP "\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "file"
the relative path from the top directory of the package source to the
file. If \fIlink\fR is not specified, \fIfile\fR can contain shell
globs and actually denote sevral files. If \fIdirectory\fR is not
specified, it is guessed from the extension of \fIfile\fR: .i files
are installed in Y_SITE/i, .gs and .gp in Y_SITE/g, .info in
Y_SITE/packages/installed, .packinfo, .aliases and .keywords in
/usr/share/yorick\-doc, and .so in Y_HOME/lib.
.IP "\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "directory"
the full path (without leading "/") into which the file should be
installed. If the file is to be installed inside Yorick's Y_SITE or
Y_HOME directory (which will almost alway be the case), it is possible
(and advisable) to not specify the full path, but to write "Y_SITE/"
or "Y_HOME" followed by the relative path from there. It is also
possible to omit this "Y_SITE/" or "Y_HOME/" prefix if \fIdirectory\fR
starts whith one of: Y_SITE/i, Y_SITE/i0, Y_SITE/i\-start, Y_SITE/g,
Y_SITE/packages, Y_HOME/bin or Y_HOME/lib.
.IP "\fIlink\fR" 4
.IX Item link
the full path to a symbolic link that should point to the installed
file. The same shortcuts apply as for \fIdirectory\fR.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
The four following lines in debian/ynstall would be equivalent:
.br
somefile.i /usr/share/yorick/i
.br
somefile.i Y_SITE/i
.br
somefile.i i
.br
somefile.i
.PP
Likewise, the following are equivalent:
.br
somefile.i /usr/share/yorick/i0
.br
somefile.i Y_SITE/i0
.br
somefile.i i0
.PP
Example with a symlink. Here, somefile.i is a script that is both useful
#included from within Yorick or from the command line. Its first line
reads "#!/usr/bin/yorick \-batch".
.br
somefile.i i usr/bin/command_name

.PP
This program is a part of yorick\-dev but is made to work with
debhelper. Note that only compatibilty level 5 has been implemented
and tested. This script is not idempotent, dh_clean \-k should be
executed between any two runs.
