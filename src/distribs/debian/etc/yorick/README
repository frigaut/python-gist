Yorick Configuration Directory
------------------------------

Any .i file in this directory will be sourced upon Yorick startup using
include_all by /usr/lib/yorick/i-start/zzdebian.i (this include_all is not
recursive).

Contains currently 20usrlocal.i : adds a local hierarchy under /usr/local
for all paths:
 /usr/local/lib/yorick/{i,contrib,i0} are added to the include path (.i files);
 /usr/local/lib/yorick/lib is added to the library path (.so files).

Although /usr/local/lib/yorick/g is added to the GISTPATH variable, the
directory is still not searched for .gs and .gp files. This is a known bug
being worked on. For the time being, use the GISTPATH environment variable to
set the path prior to calling Yorick.

Subdirectories can contain configurations for specific tasks. Currently,
/etc/yorick/packages contains a specific pkg_setup.i that configures
pkg_mngr.i to install non-debianized packages under the /usr/local tree.
/etc/yorick/packages/pkg_setup.i will be taken into account only if the local
system administrator has not removed the link
/usr/lib/yorick/packages/pkg_setup.i pointing to it.
