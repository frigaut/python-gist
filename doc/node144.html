How slice3 works</A>
</H2> 

<P>
Recall the calling sequence of slice3 (see see Section ``slice3: Plane and Isosurface Slices of a 3D mesh'' on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node89.html#slice3"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>): 

<P>
<PRE>
[nverts, xyzverts, color] = \ 
   slice3 ( m3, fslice, nv, xyzv [, fcolor [, flg 1 ]] 
   [, value = &lt;val&gt;] [, node = flg 2 ] )
</PRE>

<P>
The important arguments are m3, a mesh specification which was returned by an earlier call of 
mesh3 (see ``Creating a mesh3 argument''); fslice (which specifies either the name of a slicing 
function, a slicing plane in plane3 format (see Section ``Creating a Plane'' on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#creating_a_plane"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>), or 
the number of the function defined on the mesh with respect to which an isosurface is to be computed); 
fcolor, which (if None) specifies that the section is to be shaded, or (if a function) gives a 
set of values on the the cells specified to it when slice3 calls it; value, which in the case of an 
isosurface specifies the value of the function doing the slicing; and node, which if nonzero and color 
is calculated, says to return node-centered rather than cell-centered values. 

<P>
One of the first things that slice3 does is to call iterator3 with m3 as argument, which in 
turn calls the appropriate iterator for the particular type of mesh. (Recall that m3 contains names of 
appropriate functions to call for this mesh.) The purpose of iterator3 is to ``chunk'' up the mesh 
into manageable pieces; the main loop in slice3 calls iterator3 repeatedly until it finally returns 
None, signalling that the entire mesh has been processed. The details of both types of iterator are 
straightforward and can be had by inspecting the source code. One thing to bear in mind is that in the 
case of an unstructured mesh, iterator3 is guaranteed to return a chunk which consists of only one 
type of cell. 

<P>
Why ``chunk'' up the mesh? The creators of the Yorick version of slice3, Langer and Munro, did 
so in order to avoid the possibility of creating very large temporaries and thus, perhaps, having memory 
problems. It seemed to us judicious to do the same thing. 

<P>
The first thing done inside the slice3 main loop is to call the appropriate slicing function. Two 
functions are supplied in slice3. py. Their calling sequences and descriptions are as follows: 

<P>
<PRE>
_isosurface_slicer (m3, chunk, iso_index, _value)
</PRE>

<P>
an isosurface slicer brings back a list [vals, None] where vals is simply an 
array of the values of the <code>iso_index</code>-th mesh function on the vertices of the 
specified chunk, or (in the unstructured case) a triple, consisting of the array of 
values, an array of relative cell numbers in the chunk, and an offset to add to the 
preceding to get absolute cell numbers. 

<P>
<PRE>
_plane_slicer (m3, chunk, normal, projection)
</PRE>

<P>
In the case of a plane slice, this returns a list <code>[vals,_xyz3]</code> (or 
<code>[[vals, clist, cell_offset], _xyz3]</code> in the irregular case) 
where <code>_xyz3</code> is the 
array of vertices of the chunk. <code>_xyz3</code> is ncells by 3 by something (in the irregular 
case), ncells by 3 by 2 by 2 by 2 in the regular case, and 3 by ni by 
nj by nk otherwise. vals will be the values of the projections of the corresponding 
vertex on the normal to the plane, positive if in front, and negative if 
in back. 

<P>
In addition, the user may supply a slicing function; if so, its calling sequence must be of the form 
<PRE>
fslice (m3, chunk)
</PRE>
and it must return something resembling the returned values above. If the m3 mesh is totally unstructured, 
the chunk should be arranged so that fslice returns an ncells-by-2-by-2-by-2 [hex case] 
(or ncells-by-3-by-2 [prism] or ncells-by-5 [pyramid] or ncells-by-4 [tet]) array of vertex 
values of the slicing function. Note that a chunk of an irregular mesh always consists of just one kind 
of cell. On the other hand, if the mesh vertices are arranged in a rectangular grid (or a few patches of 
rectangular grids), the chunk should be the far less redundant rectangular patch. 
Determination of the Critical Cells 
The critical cells are those cells (if any) which are cut by the slicing plane or isosurface. There are 
precisely those cells on the vertices of which the vals returned by the slicing function changes sign. 
For cells of one of the four types present in an unstructured mesh, one adds up the number of vertices 
on which vals is negative. If this is a positive number and also less than the number of vertices for that 
cell type, then the cell is critical. In the structured case, vals is ni by nj by nk. To the array which 
is 1 where vals is negative and 0 elsewhere, we apply the <code>zcen_</code> 
(see page&nbsp;<A HREF="node128.html#zcen_"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>) function along 
each of its three dimensions. The result is an array ni-1 by nj-1 by nk-1 of values defined on 
each cell which can be one of the nine values 0., .125, .25, .375, .5, .625, .75, .875, 1.0. Those cells 
where the value is strictly between the two end values are critical. Thus we form clist, which is an 
array of absolute cell numbers of the critical cells. 

<P>
If clist is not empty, then we extract the coordinates of the critical cells, the data values at these 
points, and (if appropriate) the colors of the cells. In the case of a structured mesh, we use the 
<code>to_corners3</code> function discussed earlier (see page&nbsp;<A HREF="node119.html#to_corners3"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>) to convert cell numbers to node numbers, in 
order to get the node coordinates and data. We append a list of this to our list of results (appending 
[None, None, None, None] if clist is empty) and then continue iterating. 

<P>
Determination of the Cut Edges and the Intersection Points 
Once this loop completes, there is another for loop which loops through each type of cell (structured 
meshes are lumped under hex cells) present in the mesh, putting together the ``chunks'' of results if 
necessary. It then calls <code>find_mask</code> (page&nbsp;<A HREF="node138.html#find_mask"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>), which returns a mask array ncells * ne long 
(ncells is the total number of cells of this type, ne the number of edges on a cell) which contains 
1's corresponding to edges which are cut by the plane or isosurface (in the standard ordering discussed 
earlier in this chapter; see page&nbsp;<A HREF="node142.html#standard_ordering"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>). It is now easy to get the coordinates of the endpoints of 
the cut edges using the standard numbering embodied in the tables; we then linearly interpolate along 
the cut edges, based on the values on their endpoints, to obtain a list of coordinates of the intersections 
of the plane or isosurface with the cells. This list of points now needs to be ordered so that the polygons 
of intersection can be drawn properly. 

<P>
Ordering of the Intersection Points 
We associate with each critical cell a pattern number between 0 and 255 (non-inclusive) which 
denotes in one number the pattern of its vertices where the function value is negative. The pattern 

<P>
number is arrived at by assigning the number 2 k to the k th vertex in the cell, then adding together for 
each cell the numbers assigned to its vertices that have negative values. We now create a new pattern 
array which is ncells * ne long and in which the entry corresponding to each cut edge contains 
the same pattern number as its adjacent cell; i. e., if cell j has cut edge i and pattern number n, 
then pattern [i * ne + j] will contain n. 

<P>
The <code>_poly_permutations</code> array. To each pattern, there corresponds a permutation of the 
edges so that they occur in the order in which the edges are to be connected. Let each such permutation 
be stored as a list of integers from 0 to ne-1 such that sorting the integers into increasing order rearranges 
the edges at the corresponding indices into the correct order. (The position of unsliced edges 
in the list is arbitrary as long as the sliced edges are in the proper order relative to each other.) Let these 
permutations be stored in a ne-by-254 array <code>_poly_permutations</code>. 

<P>
<code>_poly_permutations</code> is computed (one time only) as follows. When slice3. py is imported, <code>_construct3</code> is called four times, once for each type of cell. <code>_construct3</code> first creates a 

<P>
mask array below dimensioned (2 nv-2) by nv. The row below [k] has an entry for each vertex, 
marked 0 or 1 corresponding to the pattern number k + 1. <code>_construct3</code> now calls <code>find_mask</code> 
(see ``Finding Edges Cut by Isosurfaces: find_mask'') with parameters below and the 
<code>_node_edges</code> array for that particular type of cell. <code>find_mask</code> returns an array (called mask) 

<P>
(2 nv-1) by ne in size; each set of ne consecutive entries is filled with an edge mask, i. e., the entry 
corresponding to an edge in the standard order is 1 or 0 according as the corresponding edge is cut or 
not. <code>_construct3</code> now calls construct3, a function in arrayfnsmodule (see section ``Order 
Cut Edges of a cell: construct3''), with mask and the cell type as parameters. 

<P>
The purpose of construct3 is to determine an order for the cut edges so that the polygons representing 
the plane or isosurface cut of the cell will be drawn properly. construct3 does this by 
calling an auxiliary function walk3 inside a loop, each call of walk3 being with the next ne entries 
of mask. walk3 not only decides the correct order of the points of intersection in order to draw the 
polygons, but also decides whether there are disjoint polygonal intersections with this cell. The walk3 
algorithm begins with the lowest numbered cut edge (and marks that edge as having been used) and 
examines the lowest numbered face incident upon this edge. There must be at least one other cut edge 
on this face. If the face is triangular, it looks first at the next edge counterclockwise (in the outwards 
normal direction), then (if necessary) the next one clockwise. On a square face it looks first at the opposite 
edge, then at the next one clockwise, then counterclockwise. When it has selected an edge, it 
goes to the other face incident upon that edge and repeats the process. If at some point no unused edge 
can be found, then that means a closed polygon has been found. The next unused edge with the lowest 
number is chosen (if there is one) and the process repeats. In the latter case, there is more than one 
disjoint polygonal intersection with the cell, and the number ne * (no. of disjoint polygons so far) is 
added to the edge permutations. 

<P>
Thus, for each cut cell in the mesh, <code>_poly_permutations</code> tells the order that the cutting points 
must be connected, and how many polygonal intersections there are with the cell. In the function <code>slice3</code>, 
the following instructions compute subscripts into the array of points in the correct order for drawing: 

<P>
<PRE>
pattern = take (ravel (transpose (_poly_permutations [i])), 
_no_edges [i] * (pattern-1) + edges) \ 
+ 4 * _no_edges [i] * cells 
order = argsort (pattern)
</PRE>

<P>
The order array is now used as a set of subscripts so that we can extract the coordinates of the cutting 
points in the proper order. Once this has been done, the array whose entries give the number of 
vertices in each polygon is calculated. 

<P>
There remains only the question of splitting the points in a single cell into multiple disjoint polygons. 
To do this, recall that when computing <code>_poly_permutations</code>, we had added ne (the number 
of edges on this type of cell) to any second disjoint polygon's edge list, 2 * ne to any third one, 
etc. The following will now give an array whose entries corresponding to the edge orderings for each 
cell will be 0 for the first disjoint polygon, 1 for the second, 2 for the third, and 3 for the fourth (if there 
are that many). 

<P>
<PRE>
pattern = pattern / _no_edges [i]
</PRE>

<P>
Now pattern jumps by 4 between cells, smaller jumps within cells get the list of places where a new 
value begins, and form a new pattern with values that increment by 1 between each plateau. Then the 
following relatively straightforward computation computes the nverts array. In order to fully appreciate 
how the algorithm works, we have indicated the results supposing that we began with the pattern 
<code>[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,8,8,8]</code>. 

<P>
<PRE>
pattern = dif_(pattern, 0) 
#[ 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] 
nz = nonzero (pattern) 
#[ 2,6,9,14,17] 
list = zeros (len (nz) + 1, Int) 
#[ 0,0,0,0,0,0] 
list [1:] = nz + 1 
#[ 0,3,7,10,15,18] 
newpat = zeros (len (pattern) + 1, Int) 
#[ 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 
newpat [0] = 1 
newpat [1:] = cumsum (not_equal (pattern, 0)) + 1 
#[ 1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6] 
pattern = newpat 
nverts = histogram (pattern) [1:] 
#[ 3,4,3,5,3,3]
