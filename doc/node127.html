Computing slices: slice2, slice2x, _slice2_part</A>
</H2> 

<P>
The 3D graphics in Gist itself is still experimental, and virtually all the computational functions are 
written in Yorick, an interpreted language. Many of the PyGist 3D computations were translated into 
Python from Yorick, originally including the slice2 and slice2x functions, and their auxiliary, 
<code>_slice2_part</code>. When we implemented contours and filled contours on surfaces (which is currently 
not implemented in Gist itself), we used slice2 and slice2x to compute the contours and 
the polygon lists enclosed within them. These computations were much too slow, so we rewrote 
slice2 in C (slice2x remains in Python; it just calls slice2 with a parameter set) and put them 
into the gistCmodule. The user interface to these functions has been discussed in a previous section 
``slice2 and slice2x: Slicing Surfaces with planes'', but we discuss them here from the 
viewpoint of implementation. We also discuss the ``hidden'' function <code>_slice2_part</code> here for the 
first time.

<PRE> 
[nverts, xyzverts, values] = slice2 (plane, nv, 
xyzv, vals = None, _slice2x = 0) 
[nverts, xyzverts, values, nvertb, xyzvertb, valueb] = 
slice2x (plane, nv, xyzv, vals) 
static int _slice2_part (ArrayObject * xyzc, 
ArrayObject * keep, ArrayObject * next, ArrayObject * dp, 
ArrayObject * prev, ArrayObject * last, 
ArrayObject * valc, ArrayObject ** xyzc_new, 
ArrayObject ** nvertc, ArrayObject ** valc_new, 
int freexyzc, int freevalc)

<DT><STRONG>Description</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The argument plane can be either a scalar or a plane3 (see ``Creating a Plane'' on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node85.html#creating_a_plane"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>); nv is an 
array of integers, the i th entry of which gives the number of vertices of the i th polygonal cell; <code>xyzv</code> 
are the vertices of the coordinates of the cells, with each consecutive <code>nv[i]</code> entries representing the 

<P>
vertices of the i-th cell; and vals being a set of values, one for each cell. These arguments are the 
same format as returned by slice3 and slice3mesh. 

<P>
If plane is a plane3, then vals (if not None) is a cell-centered set of values expressing the 
color of each cell, and the outputs nverts, xyzverts, and values represent the polygons and 
their colors (if any) describing the portion of the sliced surface that is on the positive side of the plane. 
That's all you get with slice2. With slice2x, you get in addition nvertb, xyzvertb, and 
valueb, which describe the part of the surface on the negative side of the slicing plane. Warning: one 
of these specifications could be None, None, None if the entire surface lies on one side of the plane. 
If plane is a scalar value, then vals must be present and must be node-centered. In this case, the 
outputs nverts, xyzverts, and values represent the polygons and their colors (if any) describing 
the portion of the sliced surface where vals on the vertices are greater than or equal to the scalar value 
plane. (This actually allows you to form an arbitrary two-dimensional slice of a surface.) With 
slice2x, you get in addition nvertb, xyzvertb, and valueb, which describe the part of the surface 
where vals on the vertices are less than the scalar value plane. 

<P>
The optional parameter <code>_slice2x</code>, if 1, tells <code>slice2</code> to return slices on both sides of the slicing 
surface or plane; if not present, or 0, then the slice on ``top'' is returned. slice2 works by deciding 
which polygons lie entirely ``above'' the slicing surface, which ones lie entirely ``below'' the slicing 
surface, and which ones are cut by the surface. If <code>_slice2x</code> is 0, then the ones ``below'' the surface 
are discarded. slice2 then calls <code>_slice2_part</code> with the polygons to be cut by the plane; once to 
get the cut polygons ``above'' the surface, then, if <code>_slice2x</code> is 1, a second time to get the cut polygons 
``below'' the surface. The list of uncut and cut polygons ``above'' the surface is concatenated and 
returned (<code>_slice2x == 0</code>); the list of uncut and cut polygons ``below'' the surface is concatenated 
and returned also if <code>_slice2x</code> is 1. 

<P>
In the case of a plane slice, suppose that the equation of the slicing plane is 
<PRE>
ax + by + cz = d
</PRE>
Then a point <code>(x1,y1,z1)</code> is considered to be on the positive side of the plane if 
<PRE>
ax 1 + by 1 + cz 1 -d &gt;= _slice2_precision
</PRE>
and on the negative side if 
<PRE>
ax 1 + by 1 + cz 1 -d &lt; _slice2_precision
</PRE>
For a discussion of <code>_slice2_precision</code>, and how to get and set its value, see Section ``Controlling 
Points Close to the Slicing Plane: _slice2_precision'' on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node116.html#_slice2_precision"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>. 

<P>
In the case of a slicing surface, vertex i is considered to be above the surface if 
<PRE>
vals [i] -plane &gt;= _slice2_precision
</PRE>
and below it if 

<P>
<PRE>
vals [i] -plane &lt; _slice2_precision
</PRE>
For all intents and purposes, the user may assume that <code>_slice2_precision</code> is 0.0, as this is the 
default. However, we allow you to change this if you think you have good reason. 

<P>
There is a conceptual difficulty for the case of a quad face all four of whose edges are cut by the 
slicing plane or surface. This can only happen when two opposite corners are above and the other two 
below the slicing plane. There are three possible ways to connect the four intersection points in two 
pairs: (1) // (2) 
<BR>
and (3) X. There is a severe problem with (1) and (2) in that a consistent decision 
must be made when connecting the points on the two cells which share the face--that is, each face must 
carry information on which way it is triangulated. For a regular 3D mesh, it is relatively easy to come 
up with a consistent scheme for triangulating faces, but for a general unstructured mesh, each face itself 
must carry this information. This presents a huge challenge for data flow, which we don't believe is 
worthwhile, because the X choice is unique, and we don't see why we shouldn't use it here. For contouring 
routines, we reject the X choice on aesthetic grounds, and perhaps that will prove to be the case 
here as well but we believe we should try the simple way out first. In this case, we are going to be 
filling these polygons with a color representing a function value in the cell. Since the adjacent cells 
should have nearly the same values, the X-traced polygons will have nearly the same color, and we 
doubt there will be an aesthetic problem. Anyway, our implementation of slice3, slice2, and 
<code>_slice2_part</code> produces the unique X (bowtied) polygons, rather than attempting to choose between 
// or 
<BR>(non-bowtied) alternatives. Besides, in the case of contours, the trivial alternating triangulation 
scheme is just as bad aesthetically as every zone triangulated the same way!
